## Analysis of Differences in TD Payment-Related Practices

### This analysis is part of the [InsighTD Project](http://td-survey.com/).

This analysis was carry out using data gathered from a survey execution in four countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the United States. 

**Goal**

the goal of this study is to characterize the current state of the practice of TD payment as described by software practitioners with different roles in the software development process. More specifically, we focus on the comparison of the most used practices on TD payment related to the size of the systems, the age of the systems and the most cited types of TD. Also, we investigate whether or not the causes for the injection of TD have any association with payment practices.

RBO implementation used in this project was taken from ÚČNK/David Lukeš: "A small Python module for calculating rank-biased overlap, a measure of similarity between ragged, possibly infinite ranked lists which may or may not contain the same items (up to the actually evaluated depth or at all). See "A similarity measure for indefinite rankings" by W. Webber, A. Moffat and J. Zobel (2011), http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1852102.1852106."
